                <p>Adjacent to the beach you will find a children's playground and volleyball court with plenty of parking available. Often you will see people playing corn hole on the grassy area up the hill from the beach.</p>
                <p>Candlewood Lake has a tennis court, basketball court and a recently opened nature trail. The trail is a work in progress. Join us in our ongoing project to make it a pleasant place to walk and visit. There are a variety of habitats for bird watchers including wooded, wetlands and grasslands to name a few. Many residents enjoy relaxing and having fun utilizing our many picnic spots. Plus there are miles of roadways that residents take advantage of when walking, running and bicycling.</p>
