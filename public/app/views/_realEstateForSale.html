                        <p>With over 1,500 acres of property in the Candlewood Lake community, buyers are afforded the opportunity to choose from a variety of lots. These lots include:</p>
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                            <li>Lakefront</li>
                            <li>1st Tier (lake view) and</li>
                            <li>2nd Tier (off-shore)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Within these three categories, there is a selection of heavily or lightly wooded lots or lots with no trees at all.</p>
                        <p>There are purchase options to build in residential house areas or in mobile home residential areas. Lots are also available in the RV Park for seasonal living/camping. Although lots are selling quickly, there are still some premier lots and groupings available. We offer several options for those interested in purchasing land at Candlewood Lake.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                        <p>The Home Owners Association offers potential residents the opportunity to view lots that are available for purchase from the Association by providing a tour guide who will review available properties with you as well as provide information about our community.</p>
                        <p>Candlewood Lake is currently featuring 6 wooded lakefront lots located on the canal around Turtle Island. These lots are situated high on a bluff overlooking the island and the lake. Five of the lots are contiguous and can be purchased separately or combined (up to 3) if a larger plot is desired. These lots are very good building sites with the ability to have a dock to enjoy beautiful Candlewood Lake.</p>
