                <p class="lead lead-lg">Candlewood Lake is known for having one of the lower boat densities per acre among private lake communities in Ohio.</p>
                <p>This means fewer boats on the lake compared to many other Ohio lakes.  Itâ€™s not uncommon to have the entire 250 acre lake to yourself on weekdays throughout the summer. The lake, surrounded by wooded lots, is easily accessible using one of two boat launch ramps. Two rental dock areas are also available for those who don't own lakefront property. There is even a security boat on the water most days to help ensure your boating experience is safe and fun. Whether you live here full time or utilize the lake for a weekend getaway, we know you will enjoy what we have to offer.</p>

        <h3 class="color-primary">More Lake Fun</h3>
        <p>In the past, when someone talked about lake fun, skiing or swimming were the first things to come to mind. But now, for those who prefer a low-key approach to a day on the lake, there are more relaxing options to consider such as various floats, recliners, and water lounges. Lazing about has evolved into a lake activity that doesn't even require you to go back to the shore to retrieve refreshments-simply reach over to your floating cooler for another beverage-and wonder how the other half lives.</p>
        <p>Candlewood Lake is perfect for many water sports. To name a few:
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>Water skiing</li>
            <li>Tubing</li>
            <li>Knee Boarding</li>
            <li>Kayaking</li>
            <li>Canoeing</li>
            <li>Water Bicycling</li>
